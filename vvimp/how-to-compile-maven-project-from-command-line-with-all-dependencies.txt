It should be quite straightforward to run your application from an IDE with some maven support (Eclipse, IntellIJ).
These IDE's will take care about creating the correct classpath.

If you want to do this manually, try this steps:

STEP 1 - change to the directory that contains the pom.xml execute the maven command:
mvn clean install

This will compile your project and create the jar you defined in the pom.xml file.
It runs the maven phases clean and every phase up to install (compile, test, etc).

STEP 2 - Then collect all jar files you use as dependencies (required to run your project):
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies

This executes the dependency plugin which will copy all dependencies into target/dependency.


STEP 3 - You can then run your main method using:
cd target/
java -cp TCPPing-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:dependency TCPPing


STEP 4 - To download just the sources, first, we should navigate to the directory containing the pom.xml and then execute the command:
mvn dependency:sources

It may take a while to download the sources. Similarly, to download just the Javadocs, we can issue the command:
mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc

Of course, we can download both of them in one command, too:
mvn dependency:sources dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc



-cp defines the classpath (all locations / jar files / folders that contain classes). TCPPing is the class your run that has a main method.

Note the : is for Linux / Mac - I think windows uses a ;.
